## The problem
I love animals. I wanted to make a website that will allow the users to adopt an animal. For now, the user is able to login and sign up and able to browse animals and add them to their favourites.


## Tools and technologies
* Ruby on rails
* Css
* Bootstrap - for the responsive menu bar
* Cloudinary - image hosting
* Heroku - hosting

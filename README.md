## The problem
I love animals. I wanted to make a website that will allow the users to adopt an animal. For now, the user is able to login and sign up and able to browse animals and add them to their favourites and send the message to the company expressing the interest in adopting an animal.


## Tools and technologies
* Ruby on rails
* Css
* Used Animate CSS - for favourite button and h1
* Bootstrap - for the responsive menu bar
* Cloudinary - image hosting
* Heroku - hosting
* Formspree - to send the message to the owner of the website
